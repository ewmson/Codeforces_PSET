  "body": "### CodeForces Problems\r\nDuring the Summer of 2016, I became interested in competitive programming. As a result, I started tackling the solutions to various problems on CodeForces, working my way from those that are most frequently solved down towards those that are less often solved. This repository is a collection of my efforts, and will be regularly updated as I solve new problems.\r\n\r\n### Help Received\r\nThroughout my journey to become a better programmer, I received help from various people. The most notable influence, however, was Hassan Almas (@halmas94), who has since been mentoring me in developing my critical thinking and logic skills, as well as helping me code solutions to problems when I don't fully understand them.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
