<p>During the Summer of 2016, I became interested in competitive programming. As a result, I started tackling the solutions to various problems on CodeForces, working my way from those that are most frequently solved down towards those that are less often solved. This repository is a collection of my efforts, and will be regularly updated as I solve new problems.</p>

<a id="help-received" class="anchor" href="#help-received" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Help Received</h3>

<p>Throughout my journey to become a better programmer, I received help from various people. The most notable influence, however, was Hassan Almas (<a href="https://github.com/halmas94" class="user-mention">@halmas94</a>), who has since been mentoring me in developing my critical thinking and logic skills, as well as helping me code solutions to problems when I don't fully understand them.</p>
